# Contact-Manager

I have made a Java Contact Manager Project using JDBC and Scanner Packages.

Modules used in the project:
In Contact Manager Project, there are two modules used:

1. import java.sql.*;
This module is used for the standard JDBC package, which allows to select, insert,
update, and delete data in SQL tables.

In this Module there are 2 main methods used in the given program:
a. Class.forName(): This Method is used to dynamically load the driver's class
file into memory, which automatically registers it.

b. DriverManager.registerDriver(): The registerDriver(Driver driver) method
of DriverManager class registers the given driver in the DriverManager's list. If
the driver is null, it returns the NullPointerException.


2. import java.util.Scanner;
The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util
package. To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of
the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.

In this Project, you can directly ADD, UPDATE, VIEW, AND DELETE your contact into the database.

IF U LIKE THE PROJECT MAKE SURE TO GIVE IT A STAR ^_^
